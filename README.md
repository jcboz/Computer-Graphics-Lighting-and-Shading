# Computer-Graphics-Lighting-and-Shading
The purpose of this project is creating a lighting effect by applying the lighting model in the vertex and fragment shaders using OpenGL. 

This project also demonstrates the creation and rendering of geometric shapes using a WebGL canvas, an interactive viewing system with an "eye" that can be moved around, and an interactive light source that can moved around to show the reflection of light off moving objects.
